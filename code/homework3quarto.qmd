# Problem 1. Personal data

## a.

[To summarize my data I could compare the mean number of floors climbed (my response variable) on school days compared to non school days. I like to hike on the weekends so I think that I will climb more floors on non school days.]

## b.

```{r}
personaldata <- read_csv(here("data", "personaldata.csv")) 
personaldata_clean <- personaldata |> clean_names()
personaldatasummary <- personaldata_clean |> 
group_by(school_day) |> 
summarize(mean = mean(floors_climbed))

ggplot(data = personaldata_clean, # start with the personaldata_clean data frame
       aes(x = school_day, # x-axis should be type of day
           y = floors_climbed, # y-axis should be number of floors climbed 
           color = school_day)) + # coloring by type of day
  geom_boxplot() + # first layer should be a boxplot
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, # making the points jitter horizontally
              height = 0) + # making sure points don't jitter vertically
  labs(x = "School Day", # labelling the x-axis
       y = "Floors Climbed") + # labelling the y-axis
   scale_color_manual(values = c("Yes" = "deepskyblue2", "No" = "deeppink2"))  + # removes the legend
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

## c.

```{r}
ggplot(data = personaldata_clean, # start with the personaldata_clean data frame
       aes(x = school_day, # x-axis should be type of day
           y = floors_climbed, # y-axis should be number of floors climbed 
           color = school_day)) + # coloring by type of day
  geom_boxplot() + # first layer should be a boxplot
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, # making the points jitter horizontally
              height = 0) + # making sure points don't jitter vertically
  labs(x = "School Day", # labelling the x-axis
       y = "Floors Climbed", # labelling the y-axis
       caption = "Floors Climbed on School Days vs. Non School Days") + 
   scale_color_manual(values = c("Yes" = "deepskyblue2", "No" = "deeppink2"))  + # removes the legend
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

## d.

```{r}
library(gt)

personaldatasummary %>%
  gt() %>%
  tab_header(
    title = "Personal Data Summary"
  ) %>%
  fmt_number(
    columns = where(is.numeric),
    decimals = 2
  ) %>%
  cols_label(
    school_day = "School Day",
    mean = "Mean # of Floors Climbed"
  )
```


# Problem 2.

## a.

[My personal data compared the amount of floors I climbed on school days compared to non school days. The the boxplot for non school days was significantly higher than the boxplot for school days. This represents the fact that I climb significantly more floors on non school days than school days. For an affective visualization I could represent the boxplots with something like buildings or mountains, where one is taller than the other.]

## d.

[In this piece I am depicting the boxplots of my personal data as buildings. This is to represent the difference in floors climbed on school days compared to non school days. I was influenced by Jill Pelto's paintings where she creates art around a graph. My work takes the form of a drawing. I created it in GoodNotes using the pencil tool.]
