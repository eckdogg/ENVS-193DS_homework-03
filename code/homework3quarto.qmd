# Problem 1. Personal data

## a.

[To summarize my data I could compare the mean number of floors climbed (my response variable) on school days compared to non school days. I like to hike on the weekends so I think that I will climb more floors on non school days.]

## b.

```{r}
personaldata <- read_csv(here("data", "personaldata.csv")) # creating an object called "personaldata" from my csv
personaldata_clean <- personaldata |> clean_names() # cleaning up the variable names
personaldatasummary <- personaldata_clean |> 
group_by(school_day) |> 
summarize(mean = mean(floors_climbed)) # taking the mean floors climbed based on type of day

ggplot(data = personaldata_clean, # start with the personaldata_clean data frame
       aes(x = school_day, # x-axis should be type of day
           y = floors_climbed, # y-axis should be number of floors climbed 
           color = school_day)) + # coloring by type of day
  geom_boxplot() + # first layer should be a boxplot
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, # making the points jitter horizontally
              height = 0) + # making sure points don't jitter vertically
  labs(x = "School Day", # labelling the x-axis
       y = "Floors Climbed") + # labelling the y-axis
   scale_color_manual(values = c("Yes" = "deepskyblue2", "No" = "deeppink2"))  + # manually setting colors
  theme(legend.position = "none") # removes the legend
```

## c.

```{r}
ggplot(data = personaldata_clean, # start with the personaldata_clean data frame
       aes(x = school_day, # x-axis should be type of day
           y = floors_climbed, # y-axis should be number of floors climbed 
           color = school_day)) + # coloring by type of day
  geom_boxplot() + # first layer should be a boxplot
  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, # making the points jitter horizontally
              height = 0) + # making sure points don't jitter vertically
  labs(x = "School Day", # labelling the x-axis
       y = "Floors Climbed", # labelling the y-axis
       caption = "Floors Climbed on School Days vs. Non School Days") + # adding caption
   scale_color_manual(values = c("Yes" = "deepskyblue2", "No" = "deeppink2"))  + # manually setting colors
  theme(legend.position = "none") # removes the legend
```

## d.

```{r}
library(gt) # Using gt package

personaldatasummary %>% # Using personaldatasummary data frame
  gt() %>% # gt function for table
  tab_header( # Adding a table header
    title = "Personal Data Summary" # Adding a title
  ) %>%
  fmt_number( 
    columns = where(is.numeric), # Formatting numerical columns
    decimals = 2 # Rounding numbers to 2 decimal places
  ) %>%
  cols_label( # Renaming columns
    school_day = "School Day", # Renaming school_day column
    mean = "Mean # of Floors Climbed" # Renaming mean column
  )
```


# Problem 2.

## a.

[My personal data compared the amount of floors I climbed on school days compared to non school days. The the boxplot for non school days was significantly higher than the boxplot for school days. This represents the fact that I climb significantly more floors on non school days than school days. For an affective visualization I could represent the boxplots with something like buildings or mountains, where one is taller than the other.]

## d.

[In this piece I am depicting the boxplots of my personal data as buildings. This is to represent the difference in floors climbed on school days compared to non school days. I was influenced by Jill Pelto's paintings where she creates art around a graph. My work takes the form of a drawing. I created it in GoodNotes using the pencil tool.]


# Problem 3.

## a.

[The statistical tests the authors are using to address their main research question are a linear mixed effect model and t-test.]

![Figure](homework3figure.JPG)

## b.

[The authors somewhat clearly visually represented their statistics in figures. The y-axis is in a logical position but the x-axis is not because it is not incremental. Standard error bars are shown on the bar graph but the underlying data is not shown.]

## c.

[The authors handled "visual clutter" well. The data:ink ratio is somewhat high. There is an adequate amount of data shown without too many visuals.]

## d.

[The most important recommendation I have is to make the x-axis in incremental order. The current order is not logical. I would start with the lowest urban percentage and work up to the highest percentage, with the control at the end. I would also make the value colors more differentiated from each other because they are currently two shades of gray. These recommendations would make the graph more aesthetic and easier to read.]
