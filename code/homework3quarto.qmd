# Problem 1. Personal data

## a.

[To summarize my data I could compare the mean number of floors climbed (my response variable) on school days compared to non school days. I like to hike on the weekends so I think that I will climb more floors on non school days.]

## b.

```{r}
personaldata <- read_csv(here("data", "personaldata.csv")) |> clean_names()
```
